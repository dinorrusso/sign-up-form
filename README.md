## The exercise is primarily about format and styling. 
The goal is not to exactly match everything.  For example, the instructions specify to use a custom font. In my case I chose **Blinker**. Image selection and colors were open.  However the input field highlighting and border behavior was specified.  Responsive deign (for mobile, etc.) was not expected as it has not been covered yet.

### The only input validation is on the password fields. 
* The Password field is checked to see if the input meets the stated criteria.
* The Confirm Password field is tested to see if it matches the Password field.
